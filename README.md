# World-Countries-Population-Analysis-Project

**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Google Colab, OpenRefine, MS Excel, Google BigQuery, SQL, Google Looker Studio

 **Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze the population distribution and growth trends of world countries based on data from the United Nations. We collected population data through web scraping from Wikipedia, preprocessed and cleaned the data, and performed SQL-based analytics in Google BigQuery. The final insights were visualized through interactive dashboards using Google Looker Studio.

**Objectives**
Collect population data of countries from Wikipedia (UN data source).

Clean and preprocess the raw dataset using OpenRefine and MS Excel.

Load and manage the dataset in Google BigQuery for scalable querying.

Perform SQL-based data analysis to identify global and regional trends.

Create clear and informative data visualizations using Looker Studio.

**Tools & Technologies**
Python (with Google Colab) – for web scraping

OpenRefine – for data cleaning using GREL scripting

MS Excel – for preliminary structuring of scraped data

Google BigQuery – for cloud-based data storage and SQL querying

Google Looker Studio – for interactive dashboards and data visualization

**Key Features**
Interactive Dashboards: Developed with Looker Studio to highlight regional population patterns and top populous countries.

BigQuery SQL Analytics: Ran advanced SQL queries to compute total population growth, identify major demographic changes, and analyze sub-regional breakdowns.

Data Cleaning with OpenRefine: Converted non-numeric values, replaced missing entries, and standardized columns using GREL expressions.

Web Scraping with Python: Extracted structured data from a public Wikipedia page and converted it into CSV format.

Collaborative Workflow: All tasks were divided equally among the three team members to ensure timely and high-quality delivery.

Team Members: Naveen Putta, Durga Srikari Maguluri, Jayadeep Bisati
